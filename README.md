# XROMM-Visualisation
Matlab code and app for visualising data from XROMM system (https://www.xromm.org/), that has been processed using XMALab and Autoscoper. Optional visualisation of motion capture markers if co-registration transformation between x-ray and mocap systems is available. 

Downloadable executable can be installed via MyAppInstaller_web.exe file in the 'xromm_visualisation_app' --> 'For distribution' folder.

Installation:
Requires Matlab (compiled on 2021).
Use the 'xromm_visualisation.mlappinstall' file to install, or clone the directory and usee the 'xromm_visualisation.mlapp' file from the Matlab app designer to see source code, along with other functions in directory. App uses BTKToolkit for loading C3D files: will need to be installed and on path for working with app source code - http://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/docs/Wrapping/Matlab/_tutorial.html

Notes:
- Bone files in list must match equivalent value in tacking file list - hence must have the same number of bones as tracking files
- Frame slider restricted to frames where there was XROMM data collected - data may not have been tracked through this whole period
- If motion capture data (C3D or MAT) file is present along with a text file containing the co-registration transformation matrix between the XROMM and Mocap coordinate systems, then visualisation is shown in the Mocap coordinate system
- Note that there is a slight timing difference between systems, such that the rate of the motion capture is 101.01% that of the xray. This is adjusted for in the app via an interpolation routine
